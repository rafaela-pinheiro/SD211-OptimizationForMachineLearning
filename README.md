# Optimization for Machine Learning (APM_4AI11_TP)
This repository contains code and resources for the Optimization for Machine Learning course. The objective of the course is to provide a theoretical understanding of optimization principles and their practical application to statistical learning problems. We learned to apply these optimization techniques to train machine learning models efficiently, including fully-connected neural networks for classification tasks such as MNIST digit recognition, using stochastic gradient descent, mini-batching, and empirical risk minimization. The course emphasizes hands-on implementation using Python frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, covering forward and backward propagation, automatic differentiation, gradient computation, and model evaluation.
